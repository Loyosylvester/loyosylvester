<center><h1>I am passionate about UX/UI and GitHUB</h1></center>
<UX> UX is the acronym for user experience
“User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.”User experiencen design </UX>
As a scientific process it could be applied to anything; street lamps, cars, Ikea shelving, and so on.
A UX designer thinks about how the experience makes the user feel, and how easy it is for the user to accomplish their desired tasks. They also observe and conduct task analyses to see how users actually complete tasks in a user flow.
User experience design is the process of developing and improving the quality of interaction between a user and all facets of a company.
User experience design is, in theory, a non-digital (cognitive science) practice, but used and defined predominantly by digital industries.
UX design is NOT about visuals; it focuses on the overall feel of the experience. 
<br>
<UI>User interface design <br>
    UI is basically the point of interaction between the user and a digital device or product—like the touchscreen on your smartphone, or the touchpad you use to select what kind of coffee you want from the coffee machine.<br>
    the UI design process and specific tasks that a UI designer can expect.<br>
    User interface design is a purely digital practice. It considers all the visual, interactive elements of a product interface—including buttons, icons, spacing, typography, color schemes, and responsive design.<br>
    The goal of UI design is to visually guide the user through a product’s interface. It’s all about creating an intuitive experience that doesn’t require the user to think too much!<br>
    UI design transfers the brand’s strengths and visual assets to a product’s interface, making sure the design is consistent, coherent, and aesthetically pleasing.<br>
